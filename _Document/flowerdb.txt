(4:01:41pm)Samim:At first I used remote ip but it's failure..
(4:02:12pm)Samim:I created remote ip
(4:06:31pm)Cameron M.:This article can walk you through how to connect that IP to your database here http://support.hostgator.com/articles/cpanel/how-to-connect-to-the-mysql-database-remotely
(4:08:39pm)Samim:I saw this link before but I did not connect db.
(4:11:57pm)Cameron M.:You used that cPanel function before and it did not work?
(4:13:40pm)Samim:If you login my cpanel you can see I created a remote IP-192.45.21.15
(4:14:23pm)Cameron M.:Ok. I will set a temporary password that will only work for 15 minutes or until I turn it off then your password will work again. Is that ok?
(4:14:53pm)Samim: define("USERNAME", 'hbs200_flowerwyz');
define("PASSWORD", 'FLO@}[WER1@T');
define("DBNAME", 'hbs200_flowerwyz');
define("HOST", '192.45.21.15');
$dbh = @mysql_connect(HOST, USERNAME, PASSWORD) or die('I cannot connect to the database because: ' . mysql_error());
$db = @mysql_select_db(DBNAME, $dbh) or die('I cannot connect to the database because: ' . mysql_error());

(5:18:12pm)Samim:Is that ok my connection string?
(5:18:34pm)Samim:I sent before.
(5:20:50pm)Cameron M.:Try using this for your code:

define('DB_NAME', 'hbs200_flowerwyz');

define('DB_USER', 'hbs200_flowerwyz');

define('DB_PASSWORD', 'FLO@}[WER1@T');

define('DB_HOST', '192.45.21.15');
(5:23:52pm)Samim:error - I cannot connect to the database because: Can't connect to MySQL server on '192.45.21.15' (4)
(5:24:34pm)Cameron M.:Ok, I'm going to look around in the cPanel a little more. Just a moment, please.
(5:24:48pm)Samim:okay
(5:27:12pm)Cameron M.:What is the IP you are trying to connect from?
(5:27:31pm)Samim:remote ip that I have to created.
(5:27:46pm)Cameron M.:What is that IP?
(5:28:15pm)Samim:Databases > RemoteMySql click on
(5:28:46pm)Cameron M.:What is the IP address?
(5:28:57pm)Samim:192.45.21.15
(5:29:41pm)Cameron M.:Ok, change the IP in the line with DB_HOST to 50.87.144.15 and that should do it.
(5:29:50pm)Samim:okay
(5:30:54pm)Samim:error - I cannot connect to the database because: Access denied for user 'hbs200_flowerwyz'@'gator4129.hostgator.com' (using password: YES)
(5:33:46pm)Cameron M.:gator4129 is the wrong server, try using gator3000.hostgator.com as the hostname instead of an IP address.
(5:37:11pm)Samim:is that correct string-

$dbh = @mysql_connect('gator3000.hostgator.com', 'hbs200_flowerwyz', 'FLO@}[WER1@T') or die('I cannot connect to the database because: ' . mysql_error());
$db = @mysql_select_db('hbs200_flowerwyz', $dbh) or die('I cannot connect to the database because: ' . mysql_error());
(5:37:12pm)Cameron M.:Does that help?
(5:40:13pm)Samim:When i update file but again error - I cannot connect to the database because: Access denied for user 'hbs200_flowerwyz'@'gator4129.hostgator.com' (using password: YES)...
Host name does not change
(5:41:54pm)Cameron M.:I'm sorry my php isn't fantastic and unfortunately troubleshooting programming is outside of our scope of support. We can try creating a new database user and giving them permissions for that database and then using that database user to connect.
(5:43:01pm)Samim:please hold on we have a three db I connect another db.
(5:43:11pm)Cameron M.:Ok.
(5:44:40pm)Samim:what will be host name?
(5:45:38pm)Cameron M.:That would depend what database you are using and what cPanel account that database is in. If it's on the same account as hbs200_flowerwyz than the hostname can be the same.
(5:47:17pm)Samim:can you know port id?
(5:48:10pm)Samim:it is not connected please help me..
(5:48:48pm)Samim:hbs200_flowerwyz in this user what will be host name?
(5:49:26pm)Cameron M.:Port is 3306
(5:50:01pm)Cameron M.:That's the same user we were using before.
(5:50:32pm)Samim:Is that correct ip -50.87.144.15
(5:51:25pm)Samim:(5:29:41pm)Cameron M.:Ok, change the IP in the line with DB_HOST to 50.87.144.15 and that should do it. this ip not connected..
(5:51:32pm)Cameron M.:That is correct.
(5:51:54pm)Samim:please check the link -https://www.flowerwyz.com/flowerwyz/
(5:52:00pm)Cameron M.:You can also try 50.87.145.226
(5:54:09pm)Samim:error- I cannot connect to the database because: Access denied for user 'hbs200_flowerwyz'@'gator4129.hostgator.com' (using password: YES)
(5:54:48pm)Samim:what will be change gator4129.hostgator.com to gator3000.hostgator.com
(5:55:25pm)Cameron M.:Everything I see here lists your site as being on gator3000. Let me check something.
(5:56:59pm)Cameron M.:Have you tried creating a new database user and using that to connect instead?
(5:57:38pm)Samim:if i created new db at that time what will be HOST?
(5:58:32pm)Cameron M.:It'll be the same host.
(5:59:07pm)Samim:You mean that HOST - 50.87.144.15 right?
(5:59:34pm)Cameron M.:That is correct.
(5:59:42pm)Samim:1 min
(6:00:02pm)Cameron M.:Sure thing.
(6:01:58pm)Samim:I created db- hbs200_lms
(6:02:52pm)Samim:no it is same error will be show- 'I cannot connect to the database because: Access denied for user 'hbs200_admin'@'gator4129.hostgator.com' (using password: YES)'
(6:03:29pm)Cameron M.:Did you give that user permission to access and modify the database in MySQL Databases?
(6:03:36pm)Samim:hbs200_lms this db properly run in to localhost
(6:04:04pm)Samim:user permission all checked
(6:04:49pm)Cameron M.:I'm sorry but I was not able to find this issue. I can make a ticket for it to be investigate more fully. We will be working hard to resolve this matter as quickly and effectively as possible, but regretfully, will not be able to continue to do so in live support.
(6:06:42pm)Samim:please I request you to once again please check.
(6:06:51pm)Samim:it's urgent
(6:07:30pm)Samim:I am waiting you please talk to another guy.
(6:07:44pm)Samim:that can help
(6:09:05pm)Cameron M.:Samim I don't have access to any more possible solutions so I am creating a ticket so we can investigate this issue with greater time and resources.
(6:10:54pm)Samim:So when it will be solve?
(6:11:21pm)Samim:In our site MySql connection string is ok.
(6:11:37pm)Samim:I think it is server problem..
(6:12:00pm)Samim:Server did not support another server.
(6:12:41pm)Cameron M.:I'm sorry but due to the nature of support tickets I am unable to generate a definitive time estimate at this time.
(6:13:13pm)Samim:May I send cpanel user/pwd for review propose?
(6:13:53pm)Samim:ok thanks Cameron for support me..
(6:14:30pm)Cameron M.:You are welcome.
(6:14:58pm)Cameron M.:One last thing, can you try resetting the password for that database user and updating the code with the new password?
(6:18:08pm)Cameron M.:Are we still connected?
(6:18:19pm)Samim:yes
(6:18:36pm)Cameron M.:Are you able to try that at this time?
(6:19:30pm)Samim:yesh
(6:20:20pm)Samim:I changed a password for db hbs200_flowerwyz but did not connect.
(6:20:31pm)Samim:I have one query
(6:20:58pm)Samim:may I used same username and db name?
(6:21:19pm)Cameron M.:Yes that won't cause an issue, as long as there's a user and database by those names.
(6:21:34pm)Samim:host problem gator4129.hostgator.com
(6:21:46pm)Samim:it is not our HOST
(6:22:05pm)Samim:my HOST is gator3000.hostgator.com
(6:22:32pm)Samim:I think for that reason it's not connected.
(6:22:56pm)Samim:How can change the HOST?
(6:23:47pm)Cameron M.:That's the field DB_HOST in the code.
(6:24:25pm)Samim:But I put that HOST it's automatically redirect gator4129.hostgator.com
(6:24:36pm)Samim:why?
(6:25:20pm)Cameron M.:I'm not able to determine that with the resources at my disposal at this time. I'm making sure to emphasize it in the ticket.
(6:26:53pm)Samim:Now what can I do?
(6:28:51pm)Cameron M.:Your ticket ID is KFR-35973217 we will be contacting you via email regarding this issue.
(6:29:51pm)Samim:okay.
